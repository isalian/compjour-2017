 - Designed the [Open Contractor project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMZuEOK4DtY) that will launch June 2017
 - Taught a [multimedia class](http://amccartney.github.io/resume/) at UC Berkeley's journalism school
 - Was an [AP-Google Journalism and Technology scholar](https://journalists.org/programs/ap-google-scholarship/) in 2014
 
 ## Questions
 
 ### 1. Choosing a dataset to go after 
 
 You've done some really interesting work using public datasets of [government contractors](https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/Default.aspx) and [missing persons](https://www.namus.gov/). As a reporter, how do you figure out where to look for an interesting, untapped dataset? In a typical newsroom, are you assigned a data question to answer, or do the reporters figure out that the data is there and then pitch a story? 
  
 ### 2. Stanford journalism M.A. highlights and lowlights
 
 Since you were recently part of the [Stanford M.A. Journalism program](http://journalism.stanford.edu/), I'm interested in hearing a bit about your experience in the program and how going through it affected your career trajectory. I'm starting my journalism coterminal degree, and wanted to know:
 - Which classes were the most enjoyable and/or useful to you?
 - What did you want to get out of the journalism program?
 - Our last speaker told us it was a better idea to get a CS degree than a journalism degree. Would you agree or disagree?
 
 ### 3. Cleaning up data in the wild
 
 Investigative, data-intensive reporting takes advantage of public datasets like the ones I mentioned above, but it sounds really hard. A [*Stanford Daily*](hhttp://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/09/30/brown-institute-showcase-features-tour-guide-drones-defense-contract-database/) story about your Open Contractors project stated that:
 
 > But if Open Contractors’ user interface is maximally intuitive, the original data certainly was not, Gonçalvez said. He explained that the single table they started out with had to be broken down into roughly 100 new tables to make more sense of the numbers. The bulk of their work went into providing the context and consistency to give users real sense of the correlations behind the figures.

 How much of the data cleaning has to be done by hand? How long did it take for the Open Contractors project before the data was clean enough for you to run a program to visualize it? How many people worked on the data coding -- in other words, did you have interns/research assistants? 
 
 ### 4. Aesthetic choices about your data
 
 Looking at your [portfolio](http://amccartney.github.io/portfolio/), I saw that you have skills in graphic design and illustration. How important do you think it is for a news application or data visualization to be not just intuitively designed, but aesthetically pleasing? In other words, do these findings resonate any more with an audience when they're pretty than when the design is just blah?  
 
 ### 5. Stories the movie team missed
  
 If you were to direct a movie or write a book about a pivotal investigative journalism piece you worked on besides the priest scandal, what would it be and why? 

 ### 6. Data journalism and political implications

 One of your recent projects was [The Wall](http://apps.revealnews.org/border-wall/). Projects like this are especially interesting ot me because they directly respond to government policy. How, if at all, do you think your work or its importance will change given the current political climate in the United States? How does data make a difference in the "real world"?
