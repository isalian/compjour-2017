 ## Questions
 
 ### 1. Future funding for investigative journalism 
 
 In your [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jkwo-nDP-4), you a lot about the need for investigative journalism to challenge sources of authority. There's been an interesting uptick in the wake of the 2016 election, where journalism subscriptions are up and donations are **pouring in** to nonprofit journalism organizations, as reported by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/business/media/nonprofit-journalism-groups-are-gearing-up-with-flood-of-donations.html?_r=0)? What are your thoughts on this? 
 
 Based on this new trend, it seems that when people are wary enough of sources of authority, they will prioritize funding for investigative reporting to ensure transparency. Does that hold true to you? And is it a good thing, or does it still leave plenty of room for corruption as long as people aren't actively suspicious of a particular institution? 
 
 ### 2. Public response to Spotlight investigation: film v. reality
 
 I found the [final scene of Spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwsAEhs1aKA) really interesting because it showed the reaction to the initial *Boston Globe* story: no one from the community was calling the front desk out of outrage, but tons of victims came forward so the Spotlight phones were ringing off the hook. If that was an accurate portrayal of reality, why do you think that is? In what other contexts might people have a "blind spot" towards wanting to believe and accept news that disagrees with their preconceived notions of the world? 
 
 ### 3. What about the non-Oscar winning investigative reports?
 
 Investigative reporting sounds like a lot of tedious work with an uncertain level of payoff. [*One article*](http://niemanreports.org/articles/shining-the-globes-spotlight-on-the-catholic-church/) stated that:
 
 > In a typical year, the four-person Spotlight Team produces two or three investigative series, with the pace broken up now and then with a one-day special report that might be turned around relatively quicklyâ€”in perhaps two or three weeks.

 Just a handful of investigative reports per year is a pretty big investment for a paper and for your own time as a reporter. How did you know which stories to pursue? Were there ever any times on the Spotlight team where you dropped a story midway because you didn't get the dramatic results you originally thought were there? If so, how much time did you spend on the story before switching tracks? 
 
 ### 4. A little too close to home
 
 In the movie, your character finds out that there's a home for these abusive priests in your neighborhood. In actuality, it was even more dramatic: it was [Father Geoghan's house](https://www.boston.com/news/untagged/2015/11/02/the-true-story-behind-that-catholic-priest-rehab-house-in-spotlight). What did that feel like? When you're looking at spreadsheets and punching in data, it must feel different from the emotional realization of how close to home a story is, right? 
 
 ### 5. Stories the movie team missed
  
 If you were to direct a movie or write a book about a pivotal investigative journalism piece you worked on besides the priest scandal, what would it be and why? 

 ### 6. What makes journalism cine-worthy?

 Several of the news stories about you [quote you saying](https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/shining-the-spotlight-on-matt-carroll-304697ac06a6) that a two-hour movie on reporting sounds pretty boring. What makes a good journalism movie? And what implications can a powerful journalism movie have for public perception about the value of a strong journalistic presence in a democratic nation?
