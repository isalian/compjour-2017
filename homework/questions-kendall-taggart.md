 - Now an investigative reporter at [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/news), formerly a data reporter for the [Center for Investigative Reporting](https://www.revealnews.org/)
 - Was part of a major investigative [report on earthquake-unsafe schools](http://californiawatch.org/earthquakes/) that won several awards
 - Won the [Barlett & Steele Award gold prize](http://businessjournalism.org/barlett-steele-awards/) for her reporting on [America's Worst Charities](http://www.tampabay.com/americas-worst-charities/)
 
 ## Questions
 
 ### 1. Digging for a story
 
 I thought your report on [Texas traffic courts]https://www.buzzfeed.com/kendalltaggart/in-texas-its-a-crime-to-be-poor?utm_term=.hjaWO5X8#.fdPkZo5y) was really great. There was a great combination of compelling personal narrative, great quotes from the clueless judges, historical context, and court records data to back up the story. How did you get wind of this story, and decide it was worth investing all that time into? How long did the reporting process take, particularly going through the court records? Was it all done by hand? 
  
 ### 2. Investigative reporting and causing societal change
 
 Your report on the [criminal charges for truancy in Texas](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/texas-school-district-suspends-truancy-policy?utm_term=.dg9lZqrd#.eb7RXb8W) actually led to social change, with the schools and the legislature reconsidering their policies. I'm curious:
 - How does it feel to know that a report you worked on actually got a law changed or improved people's lives?
 - How rare is it that that happens? In other words, what approximate percentage of your investigative stories had the impact you hoped for?
 
 ### 3. Making journalism a real-life career
 
 So, a few of us (myself included) are thinking about how to find paying journalism jobs after graduation. In this [*Q&A*](http://www.reed.edu/beyond-reed/worksdays/posts/2013/meet-kendall-taggart-09,-center-for-investigative-reporting.html), you said that:
 
 > You just have to find opportunities and walk in, say youâ€™re willing to do anything. 

 How long did it take you for people to take you seriously as a journalist and start paying you sustainable money to do what you do? Do you think your path was typical or atypical for an aspiring journalist? 
 
 ### 4. Does the data speak for itself? 
 
 Looking at the news app for [America's Worst Charities](http://www.tampabay.com/americas-worst-charities/), I noticed that it really prioritized the numbers. The main page is a sortable, searchable list of the charities and how they're spending their money. Readers have to click on a specific charity to read more about its practices, and the news app is its own page (not embedded within a traditional written piece of journalism). There are accompanying stories, but on separate webpages. How do you know when the data speaks for itself vs. when it needs the help of context and writing before readers get to the news app? 
 
 ### 5. Newsroom culture

 So you've worked as an data journalist on investigative stories for both the [Center for Investigative Reporting](https://www.revealnews.org/) and for [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/news). While CIR/Reveal is a nonprofit, BuzzFeed is on a very different model and incorporates ads and sponsored posts. What are your thoughts on these different business models of news? Did you find that they correspond to a difference in newsroom culture, or does the day-to-day job of investigative reporting stay the same?  

 ### 6. Just curious...

 This is a random one. I noticed you've done some recent reporting on Cambridge Analytica and this possibility that Trump's data people were able to use psychometrics to precisely target voters. As someone who works with data, do you think that using data to get the right message to the right people has the potential to change people's attitudes in a significant way? In other words, how powerful do you think data is?
